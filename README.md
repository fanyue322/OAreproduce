We provide the detailed analysis scripts for OA scRNA-seq analysis here. 

Section 1 contains the code for scRNA-seq integration analysis and GEO-seq data analysisï¼Œ including scRNA-seq data integrating via Harmony, marker genes identification for chondrocyte population via Seurat,  marker genes identification for each layer via DESeq2, etc. 

Section 2 contains the code for relationship among chondrocye populations analysis, i.e, trajectory via monocle2, cell-cell interactions via CellChat, sub clustering for InfC and FC via Seurat, etc.

Section 3 contains the code for DE analysis between OA and controls for scRNA-seq via Cacao and Geo-seq data via DESeq2, etc.

Section 4 contains the code for integrating scRNA-seq and bulk data via Scissor, GWAS analysis via GMMAT, etc.
