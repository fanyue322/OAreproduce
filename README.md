We provide the detailed analysis scripts for OA scRNA-seq analysis here. 

Section 1 contains the code for scRNA-seq integration analysis and GEO-seq data analysis.

Section 2 contains the code for relationship among chondrocye populations analysis, i.e, trajectory and cell-cell interactions.

Section 3 contains the code for DE analysis between OA and controls for scRNA-seq and Geo-seq data.

Section 4 contains the code for integrating scRNA-seq and bulk/GWAS data analysis.
